Council is delighted to have been ranked number 1 Solver in Victoria as part of the Snap Send Solve community satisfaction index.  

This is the third time our community has placed Whitehorse as the top-rated Victorian council on Snap Send Solve, and we’re pleased to have ranked among the top 3 Councils in Australia.  

[The Snap Send Solve app](https://www.whitehorse.vic.gov.au/snap-send-solve) operates on Apple and Android phones and devices in both English and Simplified Chinese. It allows users to snap a photo of an issue and send it through to Council to act on.  

Using the app, members of the public can snap a photo and provide a description of anything needing attention in a public space – from dumped rubbish, a broken street light, graffiti to flood or storm damage – and the appropriate council or service provider, or Solver, is alerted.  

We then pass these on to our service teams to promptly act on the requests, which can include addressing graffiti, dumped rubbish or fallen tree branches. In 2024, Whitehorse responded to more than 24,000 reports lodged through the Snap Send Solve app.  

This award was voted by the community, with thousands of app users having their say on the Solvers that impressed them during 2024. Council won the public vote from a field of 850 Solvers including other councils and organisations.  

Mayor Andrew Davenport said Snap Send Solve is a great example of simplifying a process, making it easier to report an issue at any time.  

"Council is committed to making things easier for our community and a big part of that is investing in technology and systems to improve customer experience."  

"It's fantastic to see our Whitehorse community members are utilising the app and receiving a great level of service."

The MegaMile precinct has reached an exciting milestone. Following 5 months of collaboration and momentum driven by local businesses and property owners, the MegaMile Precinct Group (MPG) was incorporated in July.

At the heart of this journey is a clear purpose and shared vision: to position the MegaMile precinct as Melbourne’s premier destination for home, lifestyle and automotive products and services.

Congratulations to the inaugural MPG Committee:

- President: Ron Gillies, Snooze  
- Vice-President: Rod Clarke, Oz Design  
- Secretary: Kristie Bailey, Carpet Court  
- Treasurer: Nick White, Inspirations Paint  
- General Committee Members: Drew Waters, Burn Brite Lights Inc; Chris McDermott, Forty Winks; and Darren Pickens, Remarkable Outdoor Living (not pictured)  

Whitehorse City Council has proudly supported this initiative, with Cr Weller and Cr Stennett commending the group on their passion for precinct development.

The MegaMile was designated as a Major Activity Centre (MAC) under the state government’s former metropolitan strategy, Melbourne 2030. The MegaMile precinct extends 3 kilometres along Whitehorse Road and adjacent side streets between the Blackburn and Mitcham pedestrian bridges.

Whitehorse City Council has adopted the Whitehorse Open Space Strategy 2025, setting a future-focused direction for how open space will be planned, protected, and enhanced across the municipality over the next 15 years.

The strategy represents a generational opportunity to plan for a healthier, more connected, and more resilient city. It ensures that, as Whitehorse grows and changes, open space remains a core part of what makes our city liveable.

### Responding to Growth and Change
Replacing the 2007 Open Space Strategy, this latest strategy responds to the significant challenges of population growth, housing intensification, climate change, and evolving community expectations. It provides a clear framework for delivering a well-connected, high-quality, and sustainable open space network that supports community health, wellbeing, and biodiversity.

### Informed by Community Voices
The Strategy is built on extensive community input. More than 2,900 community members participated in two rounds of consultation between 2022 and 2024, offering strong support for priorities such as:

- Creating new public open space  
- Protecting trees and biodiversity  
- Making parks more inclusive and accessible  
- Enhancing local play, sport, and social recreation opportunities  

Next Steps: Council will now begin the next phase, preparing a five-year implementation plan which will include initiating a planning scheme amendment to introduce the updated public open space contribution rates.

The final adopted Whitehorse Open Space Strategy and consultation summaries will be available in the coming weeks. To read more about the process visit [YourSay Open Space Strategy](https://yoursay.whitehorse.vic.gov.au/open-space-strategy)

We are on our way to achieving our goal of 30% canopy cover by 2050 through our Urban Forest Strategy 2021-2031.  

Every tree we plant today becomes tomorrow’s natural air conditioner, wildlife sanctuary and neighbourhood beautifier. During 2023-24, we planted more than 4,500 trees on Council land, each one a small investment in our community’s future.  

Did you know, the trees in your backyard are just as important as the ones in our community parks and gardens? Trees on private land are a vital component of our urban forest, contributing significantly to our overall canopy cover.

### Before you prune, chop or lop, know the rules
We want to help you care for your trees properly while protecting our growing urban forest. In Whitehorse, tree protection controls are in place to preserve our landscape character and environmental benefits.

If you are planning to remove more than 10% of any tree on your property, you will need to submit a planning permit application.

This applies to all tree removals, lopping or pruning work. Our qualified arborists review each application using science-based criteria to ensure we balance property owners’ needs with environmental protection. This process helps us maintain healthy trees and preserve the character that makes Whitehorse special. Together, we are growing more than just trees; we are cultivating a healthier, more beautiful community for everyone to enjoy.
